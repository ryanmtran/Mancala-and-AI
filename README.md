# Mancala-and-AI
Mancala is a two-player turn-based strategy game in which the objective is to capture the majority of your opponent's beans on the board. Leveraging C++ and Linux for testing, I utilized object-oriented programming to create a fully functionable game of mancala, adhering to the intricacies and rules of this complex game, while displaying the progress of the game on the IDE. This program has two modes: the first being player versus player and the second being player versus CPU. Utilizing recursion in conjunction with game trees, I implemented varying difficulty levels for prospective mancala lovers to play against. Most notably, my minimax function calculates the most optimal move based on a designated depth value, returning the move that will yield the greatest advantage based on recursive evaluations of its effect several turns in advance.
